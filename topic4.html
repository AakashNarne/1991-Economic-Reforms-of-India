    <h3>P. V. Narasimha Rao – Prime Minister (1991–1996)</h3>
    <p>Rao provided decisive political leadership and courageously backed bold economic reforms during a period of severe crisis. 
        He navigated political opposition, coordinated cabinet consensus, and facilitated legislative approvals for critical measures. 
        His pragmatic approach and vision ensured that reforms were implemented efficiently, earning him recognition as the “Father of 
        Economic Reforms” in India.</p>

    <h3>Dr. Manmohan Singh – Finance Minister</h3>
    <p>As the chief architect of India’s economic transformation, Dr. Singh designed policies that liberalized trade, promoted 
        foreign investment, and stabilized the national economy. His expertise in macroeconomics, banking reforms, and fiscal policy 
        helped restore investor confidence. Dr. Singh also introduced structural adjustments, including de-licensing of industries and 
        modernization of public financial institutions, which became key pillars of long-term growth.</p>

    <h3>Key Advisors and Bureaucrats</h3>
    <p>Senior bureaucrats and policy advisors converted high-level policy directives into actionable programs. Their contributions 
        included drafting new industrial policies, designing frameworks for disinvestment, overseeing taxation reforms, and ensuring 
        compliance. Their strategic implementation facilitated smooth transitions in trade, banking, and investment sectors without 
        causing economic shocks.</p>

    <h3>Influential Economists and Think Tanks</h3>
    <p>Renowned economists and think tanks provided critical analysis, modeling, and global insights to guide reforms. They evaluated 
        the potential impact of liberalization, privatization, and globalization policies, recommended phased implementation strategies, 
        and offered solutions to mitigate social and economic disruptions. Their work enabled policymakers to design reforms that balanced 
        growth, equity, and stability, ensuring sustainable progress.</p>

    <h3>Legacy and Global Recognition</h3>
    <p>The collaborative efforts of these key individuals not only stabilized India’s economy but also charted a roadmap for long-term 
        growth and global engagement. Internationally, these reformers are lauded for transforming India into an open-market economy, 
        attracting investment, and enhancing competitiveness. Their legacy continues to influence contemporary policy-making and economic 
        planning in India.</p>
