      <h2>Background & Causes</h2>
      <p>Understanding the economic and political circumstances that led India to launch its 1991 reforms.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content">
      <h3>Pre-Reform Economic Situation</h3>
      <p>
        India's economy functioned under a system known as the <strong>License Raj</strong> before 1991. 
        From opening a plant to boosting output, practically every corporate action required government permission. 
        After independence, this system was established to foster equality and prevent the rise of private monopolies. 
        By the 1970s and 1980s, however, it had resulted in corruption, red tape, and excessive bureaucracy.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the most part, the Indian economy was isolated from the outside world. Foreign investment was minimal, 
        the rupee was not freely convertible, and imports were heavily restricted through tariffs, sometimes exceeding 150%. 
        Consequently, India found it difficult to compete internationally, and industrial growth averaged only about 
        3–4% per year — well below its potential.
      </p>

      <h3>Macroeconomic Challenges of the 1980s</h3>
      <p>
        Government borrowing and spending during the 1980s led to some growth, but it was not sustainable. 
        Heavy external borrowing funded subsidies and public sector projects. By 1990, India’s inflation rate had surpassed 10%, 
        and the fiscal deficit had grown to roughly 8% of GDP.
      </p>
      <p>
        The nation’s dependence on imported oil made it vulnerable to global price shocks. During the 1990–91 Gulf War, 
        oil prices spiked, causing the import bill to surge and further exacerbating the trade deficit.
      </p>

      <h3>The Balance of Payments Crisis</h3>
      <p>
        By mid-1991, India faced an unprecedented <strong>balance of payments (BoP) crisis</strong>. 
        Foreign exchange reserves fell below $1 billion — barely enough for two weeks of essential imports. 
        The country was on the brink of defaulting on its international obligations.
      </p>
      <p>
        To secure emergency financing, the government had to pledge 67 tonnes of gold to the <strong>Union Bank of Switzerland</strong> 
        and the <strong>Bank of England</strong>. This dramatic measure highlighted the intensity of the crisis and the urgent need for 
        substantial reform.
      </p>

      <h3>Political and Global Context</h3>
      <p>
        Political instability compounded the crisis. Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar’s coalition government collapsed early in 1991, 
        and a new government led by <strong>P. V. Narasimha Rao</strong> took office in June. 
        He appointed renowned economist and former RBI Governor <strong>Dr. Manmohan Singh</strong> as Finance Minister.
      </p>
      <p>
        Globally, the Soviet Union was disintegrating, and many developing nations were adopting market-oriented reforms and liberalization. 
        With shrinking export markets, it became evident that India’s outdated socialist-style planning system could no longer support 
        sustainable growth.
      </p>

      <h3>The Need for Reform</h3>
      <p>
        The new government recognized that incremental measures would not suffice. India’s economic structure needed a fundamental overhaul. 
        The primary objectives were:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Control inflation and restore <strong>macroeconomic stability</strong></li>
        <li>Reduce <strong>fiscal and trade deficits</strong></li>
        <li>Dismantle the <strong>License Raj</strong> and reduce government regulation of businesses</li>
        <li>Encourage private enterprise and attract <strong>foreign investment</strong></li>
        <li>Integrate India into the global economy through <strong>trade liberalization</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These objectives laid the groundwork for the historic <strong>1991 Economic Reforms</strong>, transforming India from a 
        closed, centrally planned economy into a dynamic, market-driven system.
