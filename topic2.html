      <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8; color: #444;">
        In 1991, India faced one of its worst economic crises — falling foreign reserves, rising inflation, and heavy government debt.
        To save the economy, the government led by Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao and Finance Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh introduced the 
        <strong>LPG Model</strong> — <em>Liberalization, Privatization, and Globalization</em>. 
        These reforms completely changed how India’s economy worked, moving from a closed, government-controlled system to an open, market-driven one.
        This page explains each reform in detail and how they helped reshape India’s future.

    <h3>Overview of the 1991 Economic Reforms</h3>
    <p>Before 1991, India’s economy was based on a socialist model where the government controlled most sectors. 
      Industries needed multiple licenses to operate, imports were restricted, and foreign investment was limited. 
      However, by mid-1991, India’s foreign exchange reserves had dropped to less than two weeks’ worth of imports. 
      The country was close to defaulting on its international payments. 
      To prevent economic collapse, India adopted major policy changes — focusing on opening up the economy, attracting investment, and encouraging competition.</p>

    <h3>Liberalization</h3>
    <p>Liberalization meant reducing government restrictions and allowing businesses more freedom. 
      The goal was to make industries more efficient, competitive, and innovation-driven by ending the system known as the <strong>License Raj</strong>.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Industrial Licensing:</strong> Most industries no longer needed government approval to start or expand operations, giving rise to entrepreneurship and competition.</li>
      <li><strong>Foreign Investment:</strong> Rules were relaxed to allow foreign companies to invest in Indian industries, bringing in capital, technology, and expertise.</li>
      <li><strong>Financial Reforms:</strong> The banking and financial systems were modernized — private banks were allowed, and the stock market was restructured for transparency.</li>
      <li><strong>Trade Reforms:</strong> Import controls were eased, and tariffs were reduced so that Indian businesses could access better raw materials and machinery.</li>
      <li><strong>Exchange Rate Reforms:</strong> The Indian rupee was made partially convertible, allowing market forces to determine its value.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Liberalization gave India a much-needed push toward modernization. It created a competitive business environment and encouraged innovation, leading to rapid growth in industries like automobiles, telecommunications, and information technology.</p>

    <h3>Privatization</h3>
    <p>Privatization was aimed at reducing the role of the public sector and giving more space to private enterprises. 
      Many government-owned companies were inefficient and caused heavy financial losses. By involving private companies, the government hoped to increase productivity and reduce financial burden.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Disinvestment:</strong> The government started selling shares of public sector undertakings (PSUs) to private investors to raise funds and improve efficiency.</li>
      <li><strong>Improved Efficiency:</strong> Private ownership introduced professional management practices, accountability, and profit orientation in previously state-run sectors.</li>
      <li><strong>Reduced Fiscal Pressure:</strong> Privatization helped reduce the financial burden on the government, allowing more resources for social welfare and infrastructure.</li>
      <li><strong>Encouraged Competition:</strong> Private participation in sectors like airlines, telecommunications, and power improved service quality and customer satisfaction.</li>
      <li><strong>Public-Private Partnerships:</strong> The government promoted joint ventures between public and private sectors to combine public oversight with private efficiency.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Privatization transformed the role of the government from being a “producer” to a “facilitator” of economic growth. It made industries more dynamic and responsive to consumer needs.</p>

    <h3>Globalization</h3>
    <p>Globalization focused on connecting India’s economy with the rest of the world. 
      It allowed the country to benefit from international trade, investment, and technology. 
      The goal was to make India a part of the global marketplace and improve competitiveness.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Trade Liberalization:</strong> India reduced import duties, eliminated many quotas, and encouraged exports to boost foreign exchange earnings.</li>
      <li><strong>Foreign Direct Investment (FDI):</strong> Foreign companies were allowed to invest in India’s industries like manufacturing, IT, and retail, creating jobs and technological progress.</li>
      <li><strong>Global Competitiveness:</strong> Domestic companies faced global competition, motivating them to improve efficiency and innovation.</li>
      <li><strong>Technology and Knowledge Transfer:</strong> Collaboration with multinational corporations helped India access advanced technologies and management skills.</li>
      <li><strong>International Integration:</strong> India joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995, which strengthened its position in global trade.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Globalization opened new opportunities for India, especially in services, information technology, and exports. 
      Cities like Bangalore and Hyderabad became global IT hubs, symbolizing India’s integration into the world economy.</p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>The 1991 reforms — Liberalization, Privatization, and Globalization — marked the beginning of a new era in India’s development. 
      They ended decades of economic isolation and inefficiency, opening the path for innovation, employment, and global competitiveness. 
      Today, India’s position as one of the fastest-growing economies in the world can be traced back to the bold reforms of 1991, 
      which turned a crisis into an opportunity for transformation.</p>
